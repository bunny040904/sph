Practical 8

8. Implement a Named PL/SQL Block: PL/SQL Stored Procedure and Stored Function.
Write a Stored Procedure namely proc_Grade for the categorization of student. If marks scored by
students in examination is <=1500 and marks>=990 then student will be placed in distinction
category if marks scored are between 989 and 900 category is first class, if marks 899and 825
category is Higher Second Class.
Write a PL/SQLblock to use procedure created with above requirement.
1. Stud_Marks(name, total_marks)
2. Result(Roll,Name, Class).

CREATE TABLE student_grades (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    marks_scored INT,
    grade_category VARCHAR(50)
);



DELIMITER // -----This changes the statement delimiter temporarily to // so that the stored procedure can be created. The default delimiter ; is used to end each SQL statement, but since the procedure contains multiple statements, we need to change it to // to avoid confusion. Once the procedure is created, we set the delimiter back to ;.


CREATE PROCEDURE proc_Grade(
    IN student_id INT,
    IN marks_scored INT,
    OUT grade_category VARCHAR(50)
)
BEGIN
    -- Check the marks and assign the appropriate category
    IF marks_scored >= 990 AND marks_scored <= 1500 THEN
        SET grade_category = 'Distinction';
    ELSEIF marks_scored >= 900 AND marks_scored < 990 THEN
        SET grade_category = 'First Class';
    ELSEIF marks_scored >= 825 AND marks_scored < 900 THEN
        SET grade_category = 'Higher Second Class';
    ELSE
        SET grade_category = 'No Category';
    END IF;
    
 
END //

DELIMITER ;



SET @grade = '';
CALL proc_Grade(1, 1450, @grade);
INSERT INTO student_grades (student_id,  marks_scored, grade_category) 
VALUES (1, 1450, @grade);

---SET @grade = '';: This initializes the variable @grade, which will store the output value of the stored procedure (grade_category).

---CALL proc_Grade(1, 1450, @grade);: This calls the stored procedure proc_Grade for a student with student_id = 1 and marks_scored = 1450.

--The procedure will assign the appropriate grade to the @grade variable.
Given that the marks are 1450 (which falls between 990 and 1500), the grade assigned will be 'Distinction'.
INSERT INTO student_grades (student_id, marks_scored, grade_category):

This inserts a new record into the student_grades table.
student_id = 1, marks_scored = 1450, and the grade_category returned by the stored procedure (@grade) will be 'Distinction'.

The stored procedure could be extended to handle more complex grading systems or additional conditions.
The DELIMITER command is used for defining the procedure because it allows the use of multiple statements inside the procedure without causing syntax errors. This is specific to MySQL.
